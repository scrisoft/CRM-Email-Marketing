        This library was released on January 29, 2024, and it is normal to encounter bugs in new software. It may not work well on mobile devices, so please be aware of this limitation. I will prioritize fixing all bugs before adding new
        features. If you encounter any bugs, please report them.

        I created this library for my personal portfolio. I do not have any plans to sell it. If you would like to encourage me to continue improving it (adding more elements, modules, and advanced features like an image editor), you can do
        so by making a donation.
